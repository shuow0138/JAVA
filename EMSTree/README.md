Implemented a fundamental geometric structure, called the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST).
EMST is combined with many data structures such as graph-based minimum spanning tree, List, Set, Priority Queue.

Main functions of EMST in EMSTree.java
See Readme(description).pdf for details of the project.
